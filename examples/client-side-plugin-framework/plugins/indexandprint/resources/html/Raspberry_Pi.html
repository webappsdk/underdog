The Raspberry Pi is a series of credit card–sized single-board computers developed in England, United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation with the intent to promote the teaching of basic computer science in schools and developing countries.[6][7][8] The original Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi 2 are manufactured in several board configurations through licensed manufacturing agreements with Newark element14 (Premier Farnell), RS Components and Egoman.[9] The hardware is the same across all manufacturers.

In February 2016, the Raspberry Pi Foundation announced that they had sold eight million devices, making it the best selling UK personal computer, ahead of the Amstrad PCW.[10][11]

All Raspberry Pis include the same VideoCore IV graphics processing unit (GPU),[12] and either a single-core ARMv6-compatible CPU or a newer ARMv7-compatible quad-core one (in Pi 2); and 1 GB of RAM (in Pi 2), 512 MB (in Pi 1 models B and B+),[3][13] or 256 MB (in models A and A+, and in the older model B). They have a Secure Digital (SDHC) slot (models A and B) or a MicroSDHC one (models A+, B+, and Pi 2) for boot media and persistent storage.[14] In 2014, the Raspberry Pi Foundation launched the Compute Module, for use as a part of embedded systems for the same compute power as the original Pi.[15] In early February 2015, the next-generation Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi 2, was released.[16] That new computer board is initially available only in one configuration (model B) and has a quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU and 1 GB of RAM with remaining specifications being similar to those of the prior generation model B+. The Raspberry Pi 2 retains the same US$35 price of the model B,[17] with the US$20 model A+ remaining on sale. In November 2015, the Foundation launched the Raspberry Pi Zero, a smaller product priced at US$5.[18] Raspberry Pi 3 was released on 29 February 2016.[19]

The Foundation provides Debian and Arch Linux ARM distributions for download,[20] and promotes Python as the main programming language, with support for BBC BASIC[21] (via the RISC OS image or the Brandy Basic clone for Linux),[22] C, C++, Java,[23] Perl, Ruby,[24] Squeak Smalltalk and more also available.

On 29 February 2016, Raspberry Pi 3 is now on sale for US$35 (the same price as the existing Raspberry Pi 2). Pi 3 adds the following new features: A 1.2 GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 CPU (~10× the performance of Raspberry Pi 1 and compared with Pi 2 which is ~6× performance of Raspberry Pi 1) based on ARM's latest ARMv8-A architecture (which is compatible with older, and at first not used to its full potential); has integrated 802.11n wireless LAN and Bluetooth 4.1. Complete compatibility with Raspberry Pi 1 and 2.

Raspberry Pi 3 has a new BCM2837 SoC retaining compatibility with the GPU, CPU and connectors of its predecessors BCM2835 (Pi 1) and BCM2836 (Pi 2), so all those projects and tutorials for Pi 1 and Pi 2 hardware should continue to work. The 900 MHz 32-bit quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU complex has been replaced by a 1.2 GHz 64-bit quad-core ARM Cortex-A53. Combining a 33% increase in clock speed with various architectural enhancements, this provides a 50–60% increase in performance in 32-bit mode versus Raspberry Pi 2, or roughly a factor of ten over the original Pi 1.
