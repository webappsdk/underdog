<p>The ODROID is a series of single-board computers and tablet computers created by Hardkernel Co., Ltd., an open-source hardware company[citation needed] located in South Korea. Even though the name ‘ODROID’ is a portmanteau of ‘open’ + ‘Android’,[1] the hardware isn't actually open because some parts of the design are retained by the company.[2] Many ODROID systems are capable of running not only Android, but also regular Linux distributions.</p>
