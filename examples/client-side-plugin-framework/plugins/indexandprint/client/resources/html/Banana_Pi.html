Banana Pi is a single-board computer produced by Shenzhen LeMaker Technology Co.,Ltd, with a design that is heavily influenced by the Raspberry Pi.

The design is similar enough that most software created for the Raspberry Pi can run on the Banana Pi with little or no modification. The Banana Pi can run NetBSD, Android, Ubuntu, Debian, Archlinux and cubieboard. Raspbian can be run, though the CPU complies with the requirements of the Debian armhf port.[1] It uses the Allwinner A20 SoC (system on a chip) and as such is mostly covered by the linux-sunxi port. The boards are made in China.

Banana PI is the open source hardware platform designed to assist the Elastos.org open source OS.
